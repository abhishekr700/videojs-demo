> This repository simply demonstrates how to use the video.js record plugin for recording videos on thr frontend of your website from user's webcam. I was working on a side project and there was a requirement for adding something to record videos on frontend. What seemed like a trivial task ended up taking quite a lot of time until I found this plugin. Thus I added this repo to provide some boilerplate code for video recording.

**You will need to update the package versions in the index.html file to use the latest one**
